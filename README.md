App Idea
I want to build an app that combines task management and time tracking features to help users manage their daily tasks more efficiently. This app will allow users to create tasks, set deadlines, and track the time spent on each task. Features may include:

Calendar Integration: Sync tasks directly with the user's mobile calendar.
Time Tracking: Record actual working time on each task.
Analytical Reports: Provide insights into the user's productivity and time allocation to help optimize time management.

The goal of this app is to enhance user productivity and time utilization. While there are already many similar apps on the market, I hope to differentiate my app through a clean user interface and powerful data analysis capabilities.
